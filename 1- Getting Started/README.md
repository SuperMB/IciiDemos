# Getting Started with Icii

Welcome to Icii! Our focus is high performance, low power embedded AI. 

## Required Software
To program the Xilinx FPGAs you will need to do the following steps.

### Step 1 - Download Vivado
Vivado is Xilinx's development and programming software suite and was initially released in 2012. For use with Icii, we recommend you download the Vivado Lab Solutions Verison. This version takes up much less space on your computer and will enable to program your FPGA. If you are interested in doing other FPGA development, you may need a different version of Vivad. 

Download and install your selected version of Vivado. You will need a free Xilinx account.
